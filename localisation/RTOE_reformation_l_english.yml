 RTOE_reformation.1.t: "Cutting ties with Constantinople"
 RTOE_reformation.1.d: "In a somber assembly of the ecclesiastical council, Pope [Root.Monarch.GetName], burdened by the weight of responsibility, confronts a momentous decision regarding the spiritual unity of Christendom. The escalating tensions between the Holy See and Constantinople have reached an intolerable level, compelling the Pontiff to make a radical move: breaking the communion with the Church in Constantinople.\nWith unwavering resolve, the Pope rises to address the assembly, condemning Constantinople as a bastion of corruption and moral decay.

By severing ties, the Pope envisions a reformed and morally upright church, free from the perceived impurities that have plagued Christendom."
